## Run Instructions
Java 17 is required to run this program. Place all input files formatted as `nodex_y.txt` in the same directory as the jar file. From the terminal, navigate to that directory and run the command `java -jar starofstars.jar x y` with x being the number of arm switches and y being the number of nodes per arm switch. Both numbers must be between 2 and 16. Output files will be generated in the same directory.
